1. Website, based on ASP.net MVC 3 which collects weather data based on geolocation and outputs suggestions and forecasts.
2. Android application, used to pass information to the website.
3. Experimental Matlab code used to combine infrared and visible light images into a single image with which a plant's health can be analyzed.
